# Medical Center Management System – Database Project

Relational database design for a medical center, including ERD, schema,
normalization, and a full SQL database backup.

## 📄 Documentation
All database design details are available in:
📁 documentation/Medical_Center_Database_Documentation.pdf

This document includes:
- Functional requirements
- ER diagram
- Normalization (1NF → 3NF)
- Final database schema
- queries from project

## 🗄️ Database Backup
A full SQL backup of the database is available in:
📁 database_backup/medical_center_backup.sql

## 🐍 Data Generation
To populate the database with realistic test data, I used **Python with the Faker library** to automate the creation of sample patient records, doctor information, appointments, and other medical data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- Relational Database Design
- Database Normalization
- Python (for data generation with Faker library)

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was built as a **portfolio project** to demonstrate
practical database design skills and automated data generation techniques.
